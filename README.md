# DRMProject
Decided to upload this old project to GitHub. This is the source code from my graduate diploma titled "Development of DRM Protection for Windows XP" which I presented in 2008. This project aimed to demonstrate some Windows Internals and driver development stuff in the context of DRM protection.
